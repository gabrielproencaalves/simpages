# Explanation of templates directory

This directory contains the basic structural parts of content for building an
HTML page using the standard simpage template. And these parts are separated
into files that, when the pages are generated, are read and their content is
inserted into the final page, completing its structure. Additionally, these
files are: head.html, header.md, footer.md and nav.html. Remember: you have
complete freedom to modify them to suit your needs, even the generator scripts
can be modified, although this could break the project if not done properly. Below are explanations about the composition and purpose of each file in this directory.

## header.md

Being, by default, the first template to be read by the project scripts, the
header.md file stores the basic initial definitions used by lowdown to generate
the HTML document from the markdown file. Before lowdown is invoked, the
contents of this file are concatenated at the beginning of the article written
in user markdown. The content of header.md, by default, is

```
1 author: Your name, the creator and maintainer of website pages
2 lang: en-US
3 css: /styles/simple.css  /styles/giscus.css  /styles/table.css  /styles/images.css
```

On line 1, the text inserted after `author: ` until the end of the line will be
treated by lowdown as the name of the author of the text to be processed.

On line 2, the string written after `lang: ` until the end of the line will
define for lowdown in which language the user text was predominantly written.

On line 3, the paths separated by two spaces and placed between `css: ` and the
end of the line indicate which CSS style files should be linked to the final
HTML generated by lowdown.

Furthermore, other definitions can be added to this file to adjust the lowdown
behavior, which are detailed in the lowdown manpage.
